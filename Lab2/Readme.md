Upon request from Investor Inc., I went through the systems of Windows 10 and CentOS 7 to evaulate the controls that were in place or missing from the systems. During this evaluatio, it was noticed that multiple security implementations were not in place which could lead to extreme vulnerabilites on the machines. Throughout this evaluation, I noted missing Security Technical Implemenatation as well as implemnted vital ones to ensure the safety of the systems. Below is the outome from the evaluation with the process that was taken and my recommendations.
